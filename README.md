## THIS IS THE NEW REPO!!!

# ezclip
this app is a configurable, lightweight and open-source game clipping/recording software (so you can clip the moment when you 'ez clap' a friend (i know i'm not funny)).

this software is coded in the .net framework with winforms in c# using visual studio 2022.
please keep in mind that this is my first public c# project, so it's still pretty buggy.

# Ugly UI
The worst UI you can imagine, and yes I'm planning to change it.

# Weird Config Window
Even uglier than the main window, but yeah I don't care.

# Toolbox
Here you can:
- start/stop the service
- open, rename, upload, and delete clips
- reload the clip list
- access the config window
